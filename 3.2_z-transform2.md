## Z-Transform: A Comprehensive Overview

### Introduction

The Z-Transform is a mathematical tool used to analyze and design discrete-time systems. It serves as a bridge between the continuous-time domain, often represented by the Laplace transform (S-domain), and the discrete-time domain (Z-domain). This document delves into the definition, properties, and applications of the Z-Transform, culminating in a practical demonstration of its utilization using MATLAB.

### Definition of Z-Transform

The Z-Transform is defined for both continuous-time functions and sequences of numbers. However, for our purposes, we will focus on the one-sided Z-Transform, applicable to non-negative time values or sequences of numbers.

**Z-Transform for a time function x(t):**
$$
X(z) = Z[x(t)] = Z[x(kT)] = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} x(kT)z^{-k}
$$

**Z-Transform for a sequence of numbers x(k):**
$$
X(z) = Z[x(k)] = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} x(k)z^{-k}
$$

The essence of the Z-transform lies in converting a function in the time domain (t or k) into a function in the Z-domain, denoted by z. This transformation is achieved by mapping the continuous-time variable s from the Laplace domain to the discrete-time variable z using the relationship:

$$
Z = e^{sT}
$$

### Mapping from S-Domain to Z-Domain

The transition from the S-domain to the Z-domain involves a two-step process:

1. **Signal Sampling:** The continuous-time signal, represented by its Laplace transform F(s), is sampled at regular intervals, transforming it into a discrete-time signal F*(s). 
2. **Variable Substitution:**  Each instance of *e<sup>sT</sup>* in the sampled signal F*(s) is replaced with the variable z, resulting in the Z-transform, F(z).

### System Stability in the Z-Domain

System stability in the Z-domain is analyzed using the unit circle.  The poles of the system's transfer function, when plotted in the Z-plane, determine its stability characteristics:

* **Stable System:** All poles lie inside the unit circle.
* **Unstable System:**  At least one pole lies outside the unit circle.
* **Marginally Stable System:** At least one pole lies on the unit circle, and no poles lie outside.

### Z-Transform of Elementary Functions

We will now explore the Z-Transforms of some essential functions.

#### 1. Unit Step Function

The unit step function, denoted by u(t) or u(k), takes a value of 1 for t ≥ 0 (or k ≥ 0) and 0 otherwise.  Applying the Z-transform definition, we get:

$$
X(z) = Z[u(k)] = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} (1)z^{-k} = 1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2} + z^{-3} + ...
$$

This is a geometric series with a common ratio of $$z^{-1}$$. Its sum converges to:

$$
X(z) = \frac{1}{1-z^{-1}} = \frac{z}{z-1}, |z| > 1
$$

#### 2. Kronecker Delta Function

The Kronecker delta function, denoted by δ(k), takes a value of 1 for k = 0 and 0 otherwise. Its Z-transform is straightforward:

$$
Z[\delta(k)] = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} \delta(k)z^{-k} = 1
$$

#### 3. Unit-Ramp Function

The unit ramp function, represented by x(t) = t for t ≥ 0 and 0 otherwise, can be expressed in discrete time as x(kT) = kT.  Its Z-transform is derived as:

$$
X(z) = Z[x(kT)] = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} kTz^{-k} = T(z^{-1} + 2z^{-2} + 3z^{-3} + ...)
$$

This series can be manipulated to obtain a closed-form expression:

$$
X(z) = T \frac{z^{-1}}{(1-z^{-1})^2} = \frac{Tz}{(z-1)^2}
$$

#### 4. Polynomial Function

A general polynomial function can be expressed as x(k) = a<sup>k</sup> for k ≥ 0 and 0 otherwise.  Its Z-transform is:

$$
X(z) = Z[x(k)] = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} a^kz^{-k} = 1 + az^{-1} + a^2z^{-2} + a^3z^{-3} + ...
$$

By rewriting the terms, we recognize another geometric series:

$$
X(z) = 1 + (a^1z^{-1}) + (a^2z^{-2}) + (a^3z^{-3}) + ... = \frac{1}{1-(az)^{-1}} = \frac{z}{z-a}
$$

#### 5. Exponential Function

The exponential function, given by x(t) = e<sup>-at</sup> for t ≥ 0 and 0 otherwise, has the following Z-transform:

$$
X(z) = Z[x(kT)] = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} e^{-akT}z^{-k} = 1 + e^{-aT}z^{-1} + e^{-2aT}z^{-2} + e^{-3aT}z^{-3} + ...
$$

This is yet another geometric series that can be simplified to:

$$
X(z) = \frac{1}{1 - e^{-aT}z^{-1}} = \frac{z}{z-e^{-aT}}
$$

#### 6. Sinusoidal Function

The sinusoidal function, x(t) = sin(ωt)u(t), can be expressed using Euler's formula as:

$$
\sin(\omega t) = \frac{1}{2j}(e^{j\omega t} - e^{-j\omega t})
$$

Substituting this representation and applying the Z-transform definition, we get:

$$
X(z) = Z[\frac{1}{2j}(e^{j\omega t} - e^{-j\omega t})] = \frac{1}{2j}(\frac{z}{z-e^{j\omega T}} - \frac{z}{z-e^{-j\omega T}})
$$

Further algebraic manipulation leads to:

$$
X(z) = \frac{z \sin(\omega T)}{z^2 - 2z \cos(\omega T) + 1}
$$

### Properties of Z-Transform

The Z-Transform exhibits several useful properties that simplify its application in solving discrete-time systems. These include:

* **Linearity:**  The Z-transform of a linear combination of signals is equal to the linear combination of their individual Z-transforms.

$$
Z[ax_1(k) + bx_2(k)] = aX_1(z) + bX_2(z)
$$

* **Multiplication by a constant:**  The Z-transform of a signal multiplied by a constant is equal to the constant multiplied by the Z-transform of the signal.

$$
Z[ax(k)] = aX(z)
$$

* **Real translation (Shifting Theorem):**  The Z-transform of a time-shifted signal can be related to the original signal's Z-transform.

**Time Delay:**
$$
Z[x(k-n)u(k-n)] = z^{-n}X(z)
$$

**Time Advance:**
$$
Z[x(k+n)] = z^n[X(z) - \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} x(k)z^{-k}]
$$

### MATLAB Implementation

MATLAB offers a convenient way to calculate Z-Transforms using the `ztrans` function.  Let's demonstrate this with two examples:

**Example 1: Z-transform of sin(a*k)**

```matlab
syms a k z; % Define symbolic variables
f = sin(a*k); % Define the function
ztrans(f,z) % Calculate Z-transform
```

**Output:**

```
(z*sin(a))/(z^2 - 2*cos(a)*z + 1)
```

**Example 2: Z-transform of e<sup>-kT</sup>**

```matlab
syms k T; % Define symbolic variables
f = exp(-k*T); % Define the function
ztrans(f) % Calculate Z-transform
```

**Output:**

```
z/(z - 1/exp(T))
```

### Conclusion

The Z-Transform is a valuable mathematical tool for analyzing and designing discrete-time systems. By mapping continuous-time signals into the Z-domain, it provides a framework for understanding stability, system response, and other important characteristics. The properties of the Z-Transform simplify calculations and allow for the efficient analysis of complex systems. Moreover, software tools like MATLAB offer convenient ways to leverage the power of the Z-Transform in practical applications.
