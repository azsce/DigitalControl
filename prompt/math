Please help me format the mathematical notations in my Markdown files according to these rules:

1. All inline math expressions should be wrapped with double dollar signs ($$...$$)
2. All block/display math equations should be wrapped with double dollar signs and placed on separate lines:
   $$
   equation here
   $$
3. For summations, use \limits to place indices above and below the sum symbol:
   $$
   \sum\limits_{lower}^{upper}
   $$
4. Format fractions using \frac{numerator}{denominator}
5. For special mathematical functions and operators:
   - Use \{ and \} for set notation
   - Greek letters should use \ prefix (e.g., \delta, \omega)
   - Exponentials should use superscript notation (e^{power})
   - Use \infty for infinity symbol
6. Do this for content of mermaid blocks too

The document uses Docusaurus with:
remarkPlugins: [require('remark-math')],
rehypePlugins: [require('rehype-katex')]

Please modify the mathematical expressions in my document to follow these conventions while preserving the rest of the content.
