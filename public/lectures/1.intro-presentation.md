# Signal Types

## Analog Signals
- Continuous in time and magnitude
- Defined for all time instances

## Digital Signals
- Discrete in time
- Quantized in magnitude

# Continuous-Time and Discrete-Time Signals

* Continuous-Time Signal:
  - Value function (VF) defined over a continuous range of time
  - Magnitude of the signal is continuous
  - Example:  A sinusoidal voltage signal,  $v(t) = A \sin(\omega t)$

* Discrete-Time Signal:
  - Value function is defined only at specific time instants
  - Magnitude may be continuous or discrete
  - If the magnitude is continuous, discretization is applied to the independent variable (time)
  - If the magnitude is discrete, both time and magnitude are discretized
  - Example: A sampled voltage signal, $v(kT)$, where $k$ is an integer and $T$ is the sampling period

* Important Note:
  - All continuous-time signals are analog signals
  - Not all analog signals are continuous-time signals (discrete-time signals can also be analog if their magnitude is continuous)

# Digital Control vs. Automatic (Analog) Control

* Automatic Control Systems:
  - Traditionally used analog controllers $D(s)$
  - Output control signal $u(t)$ based on the error signal $e(t)$
  - The control signal acts on the plant (physical system, $G(s)$) to produce the desired output $y(t)$

* Why Digital Control is Preferred:
  - Automatic control systems are susceptible to several issues:
    - Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) affect component behavior
    - Component aging and tolerances lead to drift and inaccuracies
    - Noise interference degrades signal integrity
    - Limited flexibility requires hardware changes for modifications
    - Cost and complexity increase with system sophistication
    - Interfacing and debugging complexities arise from numerous analog components

* Digital Control Advantages:
  - Uses voltage levels (0 and 1) for robust signal representation
  - Reduced noise susceptibility due to digital signal processing
  - Easier modification and adaptation through software updates
  - Smaller size and lower power consumption
  - Increased accuracy and reliability due to quantization

# A/D Conversion

* A/D Converter:  Transforms an analog signal into a digital signal
* Three Key Operations:
  1. Sampling: Measuring the analog signal at regular time intervals $T$, creating discrete-time samples
  2. Quantization: Approximating the sampled values to the nearest digital levels
  3. Encoding: Representing the quantized values as binary coded numbers (BCN)

# Quantization Error and Resolution

* Quantization Error: The difference between the actual analog value and its corresponding digital representation
* Quantization Level (q): The smallest increment in the digital representation
* Full Scale (F.S.): The range of analog values the A/D converter can handle
* Resolution: The number of distinct digital levels the A/D converter can output

**Equations:**

* Quantization Level: $q = \frac{F.S.}{2^n}$
* Maximum Quantization Error:  $\frac{q}{2}$
* Number of States/Levels: $2^n$ (where $n$ is the number of bits)
* Maximum Analog Input: $(2^n - 1) \times \frac{q}{2} + \frac{q}{2}$

**Example:** An A/D converter with a 4-bit capacity and a full scale of 10 volts would have:

* Resolution: $2^4 = 16$ levels
* Quantization Level:  $\frac{10V}{16} = 0.625V$
* Maximum Quantization Error: $\frac{0.625V}{2} = 0.3125V$

# D/A Conversion

* D/A Converter: Converts a digital signal into a sampled analog signal
* Two Key Operations:
  1. Decoding:  Converting the binary coded number to its corresponding analog voltage level
  2. Holding: Maintaining the output voltage level constant until the next sample arrives

# Block Diagram of Sampled-Data System

* Figure 1: Shows a typical closed-loop continuous time control system
* Figure 2:  Depicts a general block diagram of a closed-loop sampled-data system, incorporating A/D and D/A converters.  *(Include diagrams here if available)*

# Key Points

* The conversion time of A/D converters introduces a time delay, which can impact system stability
* The output from the A/D converter is in binary format, feeding into the digital controller at the sampling rate
* The digital controller processes the signal based on the control algorithm, producing a digital output
* The D/A converter transforms the digital output to a continuous-time analog signal for the plant
* The decoder and encoder within the D/A converter can be considered constant gain operations
