## Fundamentals

<details>
<summary><strong>Q1: What is digital control?</strong></summary>

Digital control is a branch of control theory that uses digital computers and controllers to act as a system. It involves:
- Processing digital signals representing system behavior
- Outputting digital control signals to influence the system

## Signal Types

<details>
<summary><strong>Q4: What is the difference between analog and digital signals?</strong></summary>

| Analog Signals | Digital Signals |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Continuous in time and magnitude | Discrete in time |
| Any value within range | Limited to finite set of values |
| Measured at any point | Defined at specific instants |
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q5: What is the difference between continuous-time and discrete-time signals?</strong></summary>

| Continuous-Time Signals | Discrete-Time Signals |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Value function defined over a continuous range of time | Value function defined only at specific time instances |
| Magnitude is continuous | Magnitude can be continuous or discrete |
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q6: Are all continuous-time signals analog signals? Are all analog signals continuous-time signals?</strong></summary>

- Yes, all continuous-time signals are analog signals.
- No, not all analog signals are continuous-time signals. Discrete-time signals can also be analog if their magnitude is continuous.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q7: What are the three key operations involved in analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion?</strong></summary>

1. **Sampling:** Measuring the analog signal at regular time intervals (T), creating discrete-time samples.
2. **Quantization:** Approximating the sampled values to the nearest digital levels.
3. **Encoding:** Representing the quantized values as binary coded numbers (BCN).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q8: What is quantization error, and how is it related to the resolution of an A/D converter?</strong></summary>

Quantization error is the difference between the actual analog value and its corresponding digital representation. The maximum quantization error is half of the quantization level (q/2). The resolution of an A/D converter (number of distinct digital levels) is determined by the number of bits used to represent the signal (2^n) and is inversely proportional to the quantization level. A smaller quantization level (and higher resolution) leads to higher accuracy but requires more bits.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q9: What is the purpose of a D/A converter, and what are its key operations?</strong></summary>

A D/A converter transforms a digital signal back into a continuous-time analog signal. Its key operations are:
1. **Decoding:** Converting the binary coded number to its corresponding analog voltage level.
2. **Holding:** Maintaining the output voltage level constant until the next sample arrives.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q10: What are the different ways to model a continuous-time system?</strong></summary>

Continuous-time systems can be modeled using:
- **Differential Equations:** Mathematical equations that describe the relationship between the system's input, output, and their derivatives.
- **State Space Representation:** A set of first-order differential equations that describe the system's state variables and their evolution over time.
- **Transfer Function:** A mathematical function that relates the Laplace transform of the output signal to the Laplace transform of the input signal.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q11: How is a discrete-time system represented?</strong></summary>

Discrete-time systems are represented using difference equations, which describe the relationship between the system's input, output, and their values at previous time steps. They can also be represented by a pulse transfer function, which is the Z-transform equivalent of a continuous-time transfer function.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q12: What is the quantization level of a 6-bit A/D converter with a full-scale range of 10 volts?</strong></summary>

$q = \frac{10 V}{2^6} = 0.15625 V$
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q13: What is the maximum quantization error of a 3-bit A/D converter with a full-scale range of 5 volts?</strong></summary>

$q = \frac{5 V}{2^3} = 0.625 V$. Maximum error is $\frac{q}{2} = 0.3125 V$.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q14: Why are digital control systems preferred over analog control systems in many applications?</strong></summary>

Digital control systems offer better noise immunity, smaller size, lower cost, and greater flexibility for implementing different control algorithms.
