## Introduction to Digital Control Systems

### What is Digital Control?
- A branch of control theory utilizing digital computers and controllers to regulate systems.
- Involves processing digital signals representing system behavior.
- Outputting digital control signals to influence the system.

### Types of Digital Controllers:
- Microcontrollers
- Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)
- Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)
- Standard Desktop Computers

### Why Digital Control?
- **Flexibility:** Easily reprogrammable for various control algorithms and adaptation.
- **Accuracy:** High-precision signal representation, minimizing errors.
- **Noise Immunity:** Less susceptible to noise compared to analog signals.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Generally cheaper digital components.
- **Advanced Features:** Enables data logging, remote monitoring, and complex control strategies.
