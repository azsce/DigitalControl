## Digital Control vs. Automatic (Analog) Control

### Automatic Control Systems:
- Traditionally used analog controllers $D(s)$.
- Output control signal $u(t)$ based on the error signal $e(t)$.
- The control signal acts on the plant (physical system, $G(s)$) to produce the desired output $y(t)$.

### Why Digital Control is Preferred:
- Automatic control systems are susceptible to several issues:
    - Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) affect component behavior.
    - Component aging and tolerances lead to drift and inaccuracies.
    - Noise interference degrades signal integrity.
    - Limited flexibility requires hardware changes for modifications.
    - Cost and complexity increase with system sophistication.
    - Interfacing and debugging complexities arise from numerous analog components.

### Digital Control Advantages:
- Uses voltage levels (0 and 1) for robust signal representation.
- Reduced noise susceptibility due to digital signal processing.
- Easier modification and adaptation through software updates.
- Smaller size and lower power consumption.
- Increased accuracy and reliability due to quantization.
