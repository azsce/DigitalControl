Given the input $$R(s) = \frac{1}{s}$$ (which represents a unit step function) and the initial condition $$y(0) = 1$$, find:

1. The pulse transfer function,
2. The discrete-time state space representation,
3. The stability of the system,

where the system's difference equation is given by:

$$
y(k+3) + 2y(k+2) + 3y(k+1) + 2y(k) = r(k+1) + r(k)
$$

---

### 1. Pulse Transfer Function

To find the pulse transfer function $$G(z) = \frac{Y(z)}{R(z)}$$, we take the Z-transform of the difference equation assuming zero initial conditions:

$$
z^3 Y(z) + 2z^2 Y(z) + 3z Y(z) + 2Y(z) = z R(z) + R(z)
$$

Solving for $$G(z)$$:

$$
G(z) = \frac{Y(z)}{R(z)} = \frac{z + 1}{z^3 + 2z^2 + 3z + 2}
$$

### 2. Discrete-Time State Space Representation

We define the state variables as:

$$
x_1(k) = y(k), \quad x_2(k) = y(k+1), \quad x_3(k) = y(k+2)
$$

The state equations are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_1(k+1) &= x_2(k) \\
x_2(k+1) &= x_3(k) \\
x_3(k+1) &= -2x_3(k) - 3x_2(k) - 2x_1(k) + r(k+1) + r(k)
\end{aligned}
$$

In matrix form:

$$
x(k+1) = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
-2 & -3 & -2
\end{bmatrix} x(k) + \begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
1
\end{bmatrix} r(k+1) + \begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
1
\end{bmatrix} r(k)
$$

The output equation is:

$$
y(k) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} x(k)
$$

### 3. Stability of the System

System stability in the Z-domain is analyzed using the unit circle. The poles of the system's transfer function, when plotted in the Z-plane, determine its stability characteristics:

- **Stable System:** All poles lie inside the unit circle.
- **Unstable System:** At least one pole lies outside the unit circle.
- **Marginally Stable System:** At least one pole lies on the unit circle, and no poles lie outside.

To assess stability, we find the poles of the transfer function by solving:

$$
z^3 + 2z^2 + 3z + 2 = 0
$$

One root is $$z = -1$$. Factoring:

$$
(z + 1)(z^2 + z + 2) = 0
$$

The remaining roots are:

$$
z = \frac{-1 \pm j\sqrt{7}}{2}
$$

The magnitudes of these roots are:

$$
|z| = \sqrt{\left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{7}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{7}{4}} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414
$$

Since $$\sqrt{2} > 1$$, these poles lie **outside** the unit circle. Additionally, the pole at $$z = -1$$ lies **on** the unit circle.

### Stability Conclusion

- The system has **one pole on the unit circle** ($$z = -1$$) and **two poles outside the unit circle** ($$z = \frac{-1 \pm j\sqrt{7}}{2}$$).
- According to the stability criteria:
  - At least one pole lies outside the unit circle, and at least one pole lies on the unit circle.
- Therefore, the system is **unstable**.

### Conclusion

1. **Pulse Transfer Function:**

   $$
   G(z) = \frac{z + 1}{z^3 + 2z^2 + 3z + 2}
   $$

2. **Discrete-Time State Space Representation:**

   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   x(k+1) &= \begin{bmatrix}
   0 & 1 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 1 \\
   -2 & -3 & -2
   \end{bmatrix} x(k) + \begin{bmatrix}
   0 \\
   0 \\
   1
   \end{bmatrix} r(k+1) + \begin{bmatrix}
   0 \\
   0 \\
   1
   \end{bmatrix} r(k) \\
   y(k) &= \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} x(k)
   \end{aligned}
   $$

3. **Stability:**

   The system is **unstable** because the poles are not all inside the unit circle.
