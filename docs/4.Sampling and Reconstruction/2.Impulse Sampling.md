# Impulse Sampling

Impulse sampling is a method of converting a continuous-time signal, $$x(t)$$, into a discrete-time signal, $$x^*(t)$$, by representing it as a series of weighted impulses. These impulses occur at sampling instants $$kT$$, where $$T$$ is the sampling period, and $$k$$ is an integer. The weight of each impulse is equal to the value of the continuous-time signal at the corresponding instant.

## Key Differences Between Impulse and Standard Sampling

1. **Impulse Sampling**: Produces a train of weighted impulses, where each impulse's weight equals the signal's value at the sampling instant. The output remains in the continuous-time domain as a sum of impulses.
2. **Standard Sampling**: Discretizes the continuous-time signal into a sequence of discrete values, $$x(kT)$$, without producing impulses.

## Mathematical Representation

The impulse-sampled output, $$x^*(t)$$, is mathematically expressed as:

$$
x^*(t) = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} x(kT)\delta(t - kT)
$$


Where:
- $$x(t)$$ is the original continuous-time signal.
- $$x^*(t)$$ is the impulse-sampled signal.
- $$\delta(t)$$ is the Dirac delta function.
- $$k$$ is an integer representing the sample number.
- $$T$$ is the sampling period.
- $$x(kT)$$ is a number sequence, not a time signal.
- $$\sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} \delta(t - kT)$$ is called the Dirac Comb.
- $$x^*(t)$$ is a discontinuous time function.


This can be expanded as:

$$
x^*(t) = x(0)\delta(t) + x(T)\delta(t - T) + x(2T)\delta(t - 2T) + \dots
$$



Where:
- $$\delta(t), \delta(t - T), \dots, \delta(t - kT), \dots$$ is a train of unit impulses.

The summation $$\sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} \delta(t - kT)$$ is often referred to as the Dirac Comb, and $$x^*(t)$$ is considered a discontinuous time function.

This equation shows that $$x^{*}(t)$$ is composed of a series of shifted and scaled delta functions.  The scaling factor for each delta function is the value of the original signal, $$x(t)$$, at the corresponding sampling instant.

## s-Domain Representation
To analyze **$$x^*(t)$$** in the **s-domain**, we take its **Laplace transform**. This representation in the time domain can also be expressed in the s-domain. If **$$X(s)$$** is the Laplace transform of **$$x(t)$$**, and **$$X^{*}(s)$$** is the Laplace transform of **$$x^{*}(t)$$**, then applying the impulse sampler to **$$X(s)$$** will yield **$$X^{*}(s)$$**.

The Laplace transform of the impulse-sampled signal, **$$x^*(t)$$**, is derived using the **time-shifting property** of the **delta function**:

$$
X^*(s) = x(0)\mathcal{L}[\delta(t)] + x(T)\mathcal{L}[\delta(t - T)] + \dots
$$

Using the time-shifting property, **$$\mathcal{L}[\delta(t - kT)] = e^{-kT s}$$**, we get:

$$
X^*(s) = x(0) + x(T)e^{-T s} + x(2T)e^{-2T s} + \dots
$$

This can be written in a general form:

$$
X^*(s) = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} x(kT) e^{-kT s}
$$

### Mapping to the z-Domain

The $$z$$-transform, $$X(z)$$, relates to the Laplace transform of the impulse-sampled signal, $$X^*(s)$$, through the mapping:

$$
e^{T s} = z \quad \text{or equivalently,} \quad s = \frac{1}{T}\ln(z)
$$

Substituting:

$$
X^*(s)\big|_{s=\frac{1}{T}\ln(z)} = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} x(kT) z^{-k} = X(z)
$$

This relationship highlights how the impulse-sampled signal transitions between the s-domain and z-domain representations.

### Example: Laplace and z-Transforms

Given $$x(t) = e^{-at}$$, find its Laplace transform $$X(s)$$ and z-transform $$X(z)$$.

**Solution:**

1. **Laplace Transform:** The Laplace transform of $$x(t) = e^{-at}$$ is $$X(s) = \frac{1}{s+a}$$.
2. **z-Transform:** The z-transform of $$x(t) = e^{-at}$$ is $$X(z) = \frac{1}{1 - e^{-aT_{s}}z^{-1}} = \frac{z}{z - e^{-aT_{s}}}$$.

## Questions and Answers

1. **What is impulse sampling?**  
   Impulse sampling is a method of converting a continuous-time signal into a discrete-time signal represented as a series of weighted impulses.

2. **How is the impulse-sampled signal $$x^*(t)$$ related to the original signal $$x(t)$$?**  
   The weights of the impulses in $$x^*(t)$$ are the values of $$x(t)$$ at the sampling instants, $$kT$$.

3. **How is the z-transform related to the Laplace transform of the impulse-sampled signal?**  
   The z-transform, $$X(z)$$, is derived from $$X^*(s)$$, the Laplace transform of the impulse-sampled signal, using the substitution $$s = \frac{1}{T}\ln(z)$$.

4. **Can $$X(z)$$ be obtained directly from $$X(s)$$ by substituting $$s = \frac{1}{T}\ln(z)$$?**  
   No. $$X(z)$$ represents the z-transform of the original continuous signal, while $$X^*(s)$$ is the Laplace transform of the impulse-sampled signal. The mapping establishes a relationship but does not make them directly equivalent.
