# Impulse Response

The impulse response of a system is its output when the input is an impulse function (also known as a Kronecker delta). In the discrete-time domain, the impulse function, $$\delta(k)$$, has a value of 1 at $$k=0$$ and 0 for all other values of $$k$$.

The Z-Transform of the impulse function is:

$$
Z\{\delta(k)\} = 1
$$

The pulse transfer function, $$G(z)$$, relates the output $$Y(z)$$ to the input $$X(z)$$ in the z-domain:

$$
G(z) = \frac{Y(z)}{X(z)}
$$

When the input is an impulse function, the output $$Y(z)$$ is equal to the impulse response. Thus, $$G(z)$$ itself represents the impulse response.

## Impulse Response Calculation Methods

This section outlines three methods for calculating the impulse response of a discrete-time system, given its numerator and denominator coefficients.

**System Definition**

The system is defined by its transfer function in the z-domain:

$$
G(z) = \frac{\text{num}(z)}{\text{den}(z)}
$$

where `num` and `den` represent the numerator and denominator polynomial coefficients, respectively. For example:

$$
\text{num} = [0, 0.4673, -0.3393] \\
\text{den} = [1, -1.5327, 0.6667]
$$

### Method 1: Using the `filter` Function

This method uses the `filter` function to simulate the system's response to a discrete-time impulse.

1. **Define Coefficients**  
   Define the numerator and denominator coefficients:

   ```matlab
   num = [0, 0.4673, -0.3393];
   den = [1, -1.5327, 0.6667];
   ```

2. **Create the Impulse Input**  
   Create a vector representing the impulse input signal (Kronecker delta)  (1 at $$k=0$$, zeros elsewhere):

   ```matlab
   x = [1 zeros(1,40)];
   ```

3. **Compute the Output**  
   Apply the `filter` function:

   ```matlab
   y = filter(num, den, x);
   ```

4. **Plot the Impulse Response**  
   Use the `stem` function to visualize the response:

   ```matlab
   stem(y);
   ```

### Method 2: Using the `impz` Function

The `impz` function directly computes the impulse response.

1. **Define Coefficients**  
   Use the same `num` and `den` as in Method 1.

2. **Compute the Impulse Response**  
   Calculate the impulse response using:

   ```matlab
   y = impz(num, den);
   ```

   To specify a certain number of samples (e.g., 8):

   ```matlab
   y = impz(num, den, 8);
   ```

3. **Plot with Sampling Time**  
   You can optionally include a sampling time, Ts, and use it in your plot:

   ```matlab
   Ts = 1; % Sampling time
   t = [0:Ts:7]; % Time vector
   stem(t, y);
   ```

### Method 3: Using the `tf` and `impulse` Functions

This method creates a transfer function object and computes the impulse response.

1. **Define Coefficients**  
   Use the same `num` and `den` as in Method 1.

2. **Create the Transfer Function**  
   Define the system using `tf`:

   ```matlab
   Gd = tf(num, den, 1); % Assuming a sampling time of 1
   ```

3. **Compute the Impulse Response**  
   Use the `impulse` function:

   ```matlab
   impulse(Gd);
   ```

---

## Example Results and Discussion

All three methods yield consistent impulse response values but may differ in visualization due to the representation of time (discrete vs. continuous) and plotting styles (stems vs. continuous lines). For example, Method 1 uses discrete points, while Method 3 can provide a more continuous appearance when a sampling time is introduced.

### Questions and Answers

1. **What is the impulse response of a system?**  
   The impulse response is the output of a system when the input is an impulse function.

2. **What is the Z-Transform of the impulse function?**  
   The Z-Transform of the impulse function, $$\delta(k)$$, is 1.

3. **How can you calculate the impulse response in MATLAB?**  
   Use the `filter`, `impz`, or `impulse` functions, depending on your preferred method and visualization needs.

4. **What is the significance of the `-1` argument in `tf(num, den, -1)`?**  
   It specifies a discrete-time system without a defined sampling period. To include a sampling time, specify a positive value, e.g., `tf(num, den, 1)`.
