## Z-Transform

### 1. Z-Transform vs Laplace Transform
**Q: What is the main advantage of using the Z-transform over the Laplace transform for analyzing discrete-time signals?**

**A:** The Z-transform converts irrational functions from the Laplace transform into rational functions in the z-domain, which are easier to manipulate and analyze.

### 2. Pole Location and Stability
**Q: How does the location of poles in the z-plane relate to the stability of a discrete-time system?**

**A:** The stability of a system can be determined by pole locations:
- Poles inside the unit circle → System is stable
- Poles outside the unit circle → System is unstable
- Poles on the unit circle → System has marginal stability

### 3. Domain Mapping
**Q: What are the key steps involved in mapping a point from the s-domain to the z-domain?**

**A:** The mapping process involves:
- Substitute $$s$$ with $$\delta+j\omega$$ (where $$\delta$$ is real part, $$\omega$$ is imaginary part)
- Use the equation $$z = e^{sT}$$ for the transformation

### 4. System Causality
**Q: How can the Z-transform be used to determine the causality of a discrete-time system?**

**A:** Causality can be determined by analyzing the pulse transfer function:
- Compare orders of numerator and denominator polynomials
- If denominator order ≥ numerator order → System is likely causal

### 5. Z-Domain Analysis Benefits
**Q: What are the benefits of analyzing a system in the z-domain compared to the time domain?**

**A:** The z-domain analysis offers several advantages:
- Simpler representation of sampled signals
- Easier manipulation of system equations
- Direct insight into system stability through pole locations


## Inverse Z-Transform
### 1. Inverse Z-Transform Purpose
**Q: What is the primary purpose of the inverse Z-transform?**

**A:** The inverse Z-transform is used to recover the original discrete-time sequence from its Z-transform.

### 2. Power Series Method
**Q: How does the power series method work?**

**A:** The method involves:
- Finding the power series representation of $$X(z)$$ in terms of $$z^{-k}$$
- Identifying the coefficients of the series
- These coefficients directly correspond to the values of the original sequence

### 3. Partial Fraction Expansion
**Q: When is partial fraction expansion useful?**

**A:** Partial fraction expansion is particularly useful when:
- $$X(z)$$ is a rational function
- The function needs to be decomposed into simpler terms for analysis
- Complex fractions need to be broken down into manageable components

### 4. Residue Method Comparison
**Q: How is the residue method similar to the Laplace transform inversion?**

**A:** The residue method shares key characteristics with Laplace transform inversion:
- Uses similar contour integral techniques
- Involves calculating and summing residues at the poles of a function
