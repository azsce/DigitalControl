## Digital Control Systems: Mathematical Modeling of the Sampling Process

**Introduction**

This lecture continues the discussion on digital control systems, focusing specifically on the mathematical modeling of the sampling process. This process is crucial for converting continuous-time signals into discrete-time signals suitable for digital processing. While analog-to-digital converters (A/D) play a role in a complete digital control system, this lecture specifically simplifies the model by considering only the sampling process itself, independent of A/D conversion specifics.

**Key Concepts**

The core of sampling is based on converting a continuous signal into a pulse-modulated or discrete signal. There are three main types of pulse modulation:

1. Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM): The amplitude of a pulse train is varied according to the instantaneous value of the input signal. This is the most commonly used method and the focus of this lecture.
2. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM): The width of a pulse train is varied according to the instantaneous value of the input signal.
3. Pulse Frequency Modulation (PFM): The frequency of a pulse train is varied according to the instantaneous value of the input signal.

**Mathematical Model**

A continuous signal $f(t)$ is sampled by multiplying it with a unit pulse train $p(t)$ to produce the sampled signal $f^*(t)$. The unit pulse train $p(t)$ is periodic with period $T$ and a pulse duration of $p$. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

$$
p(t) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} [u_s(t-kT) - u_s(t-kT-p)]
$$

where $u_s(t)$ is the unit step function.

The sampled signal $f^*(t)$ is therefore:

$$
f^*(t) = f(t) \cdot p(t)
$$

**Frequency Domain Analysis**

To understand the effects of sampling in the frequency domain, Fourier analysis is employed. Since $p(t)$ is periodic, it can be represented by a Fourier series:

$$
p(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} C_n e^{jn\omega_o t}
$$

where $\omega_o = \frac{2\pi}{T}$ is the sampling frequency, and $C_n$ are the complex Fourier series coefficients.

The coefficients $C_n$ can be calculated as:

$$
C_n = \frac{p}{T} \cdot \frac{\sin(n\omega_o p/2)}{n\omega_o p/2} \cdot e^{-jn\omega_o p/2}
$$

The magnitude of $C_n$ is therefore:

$$
|C_n| = \frac{p}{T} \cdot \frac{\sin(n\omega_o p/2)}{n\omega_o p/2}
$$

This is a sinc function, which has a peak at $n = 0$ and zeros at multiples of $\pi$.

The sampled signal $f^*(t)$ in the frequency domain, $F^*(j\omega)$, is a shifted and scaled version of the original signal's spectrum $F(j\omega)$:

$$
F^*(j\omega) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} C_n F(j\omega + jn\omega_s)
$$

When $n=0$, this simplifies to:

$$
F^*(j\omega) = \frac{p}{T} F(j\omega)
$$

**Nyquist Rate and Aliasing**

A crucial concept in sampling is the Nyquist rate (or frequency $\omega_c$). The Nyquist rate is twice the highest frequency component ($\omega_c$) present in the original signal. The sampling frequency ($\omega_s$) must be greater than the Nyquist rate to avoid aliasing.

Aliasing occurs when the sampling frequency is too low, causing higher frequency components of the original signal to be "folded" back into the lower frequency range, distorting the reconstructed signal. This creates frequencies in the sampled signal that weren't present in the original, continuous signal. To avoid aliasing, the sampling frequency $\omega_s$ should be at least twice the highest frequency present in the input signal ($\omega_c$), formally expressed as:

$$
\frac{\omega_s}{2} > \omega_c
$$


Mathematical Modeling of Sampling Process
The goal is to represent a sampled signal in the s-domain, which is useful for analyzing systems that involve sampling, such as digital control systems.

Key Concepts

* **Laplace Transform and the s-Domain:** The Laplace transform converts a time-domain function, $f(t)$, into an s-domain function, $F(s)$. This transform is defined as:

$$
\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} = F(s) = \int_0^\infty f(t)e^{-st} dt
$$

* **Sampled Signal Representation:** When a continuous signal, $f(t)$, is sampled, the output is a discrete-time signal, $f^*(t)$. Mathematically, this sampled signal can be represented as the product of the original signal and a unit pulse train, $p(t)$:

$$
f^*(t) = f(t) \cdot p(t)
$$

* **Unit Pulse Train:** The unit pulse train, $p(t)$, is a series of pulses with unit amplitude, occurring at regular intervals (the sampling period, $T$). It acts as a switch, effectively "picking out" values of the continuous signal at the sampling instants.

* **s-Domain Representation of Sampled Signal:** Taking the Laplace transform of the sampled signal representation yields:

$$
F^*(s) = \mathcal{L}\{f^*(t)\} = F(s) \otimes P(s)
$$

Where $\otimes$ denotes complex convolution, and $P(s)$ is the Laplace transform of the unit pulse train, $p(t)$.

* **Flat-top Approximation:** If the sampling duration ($p$) is significantly shorter than the sampling period ($T$) and the smallest time constant of the original signal, the sampler output can be approximated by a sequence of rectangular pulses. Under this approximation, the sampled signal can be simplified as:

$$
f^*(t) \approx f(kT) \cdot p(t)
$$

Where $kT$ represents the sampling instants. This simplification significantly reduces the complexity of analysis.

* **The Ideal Sampler:** In an ideal sampler, the sampling duration $p$ approaches zero, implying instantaneous sampling. This means the sampler switches between closed and open states instantaneously. The output of an ideal sampler is usually represented using the unit impulse function, $\delta(t)$:

$$
f^*(t) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} f(kT) \delta(t-kT)
$$

Taking the Laplace transform results in:

$$
F^*(s) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} f(kT)e^{-kTs}
$$

Examples

**Example 1: $f(t) = t$**

1. Find the Laplace transform of $f(t)$: $F(s) = 1/s^2$

2. Apply the flat-top approximation for the sampled signal: $f^*(t) \approx f(kT) \cdot p(t) = kT \cdot p(t)$

3. Express $F^*(s)$ using the definition of the Laplace transform of a sampled signal:

$$
F^*(s) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} kT \cdot e^{-kTs}
$$

4. Multiply both sides by $e^{-Ts}$:

$$
e^{-Ts} F^*(s) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (k-1)T \cdot e^{-kTs}
$$

5. Subtract the second equation from the first:

$$
F^*(s)(1-e^{-Ts}) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} T \cdot e^{-kTs} = \frac{T}{1-e^{-Ts}}
$$

6. Thus:

$$
F^*(s) = \frac{T \cdot e^{-Ts}}{(1-e^{-Ts})^2}
$$

**Example 2: $F(s) = e^{-Ts}/(s+a)$**

1. Find the inverse Laplace transform of $F(s)$: $f(t) = e^{-a(t-T)}$

2. Evaluate $f(t)$ at the sampling instants: $f(kT) = e^{-a(kT-T)}$

3. Express $F^*(s)$ using the definition of the Laplace transform of a sampled signal:

$$
F^*(s) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} f(kT)e^{-kTs} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} e^{-a(kT-T)} e^{-kTs} = e^{aT} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} e^{-kT(s+a)} = \frac{e^{aT}}{1-e^{-T(s+a)}}
$$

Conclusion

The lecture presents two main methods for describing signals in the s-domain, specifically the Laplace transform. It introduces the unit pulse train as a key component for describing how continuous-time signals can be mathematically represented in the s-domain using complex convolution. In certain cases, such as small sampling duration compared to sampling time, an approximation of continuous function can be represented using a simpler mathematical model.
