Transforms an analog signal into a digital signal.

### Three Key Operations:
1. **Sampling:** Measuring the analog signal at regular time intervals $T$, creating discrete-time samples.
2. **Quantization:** Approximating the sampled values to the nearest digital levels.
3. **Encoding:** Representing the quantized values as binary coded numbers (BCN).
