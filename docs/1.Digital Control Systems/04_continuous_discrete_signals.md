### Continuous-Time Signal:
- Value function (VF) defined over a continuous range of time.
- Magnitude of the signal is continuous.
- Example: A sinusoidal voltage signal, $v(t) = A \sin(\omega t)$

### Discrete-Time Signal:
- Value function is defined only at specific time instants.
- Magnitude may be continuous or discrete.
- If the magnitude is continuous, discretization is applied to the independent variable (time).
- If the magnitude is discrete, both time and magnitude are discretized.
- Example: A sampled voltage signal, $v(kT)$, where $k$ is an integer and $T$ is the sampling period.

### Important Note:
- All continuous-time signals are analog signals.
- Not all analog signals are continuous-time signals (discrete-time signals can also be analog if their magnitude is continuous).
