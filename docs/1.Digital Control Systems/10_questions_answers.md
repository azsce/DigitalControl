<summary><strong>Q7: What are the three key operations involved in analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion?</strong></summary>

<div style={{paddingLeft: "20px"}}>
	1. **Sampling:** Measuring the analog signal at regular time intervals (T), creating discrete-time samples.
	2. **Quantization:** Approximating the sampled values to the nearest digital levels.
	3. **Encoding:** Representing the quantized values as binary coded numbers (BCN).
</div>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q8: What is quantization error, and how is it related to the resolution of an A/D converter?</strong></summary>

<div style={{paddingLeft: "20px"}}>
	Quantization error is the difference between the actual analog value and its corresponding digital representation. The maximum quantization error is half of the quantization level (q/2). The resolution of an A/D converter (number of distinct digital levels) is determined by the number of bits used to represent the signal (2^n) and is inversely proportional to the quantization level. A smaller quantization level (and higher resolution) leads to higher accuracy but requires more bits.

<summary><strong>Q9: What is the purpose of a D/A converter, and what are its key operations?</strong></summary>

<div style={{paddingLeft: "20px"}}>
	A D/A converter transforms a digital signal back into a continuous-time analog signal. Its key operations are:
	1. **Decoding:** Converting the binary coded number to its corresponding analog voltage level.
	2. **Holding:** Maintaining the output voltage level constant until the next sample arrives.

<summary><strong>Q10: What are the different ways to model a continuous-time system?</strong></summary>

<div style={{paddingLeft: "20px"}}>
	Continuous-time systems can be modeled using:
	- **Differential Equations:** Mathematical equations that describe the relationship between the system's input, output, and their derivatives.
	- **State Space Representation:** A set of first-order differential equations that describe the system's state variables and their evolution over time.
	- **Transfer Function:** A mathematical function that relates the Laplace transform of the output signal to the Laplace transform of the input signal.

<summary><strong>Q11: How is a discrete-time system represented?</strong></summary>

<div style={{paddingLeft: "20px"}}>
	Discrete-time systems are represented using difference equations, which describe the relationship between the system's input, output, and their values at previous time steps. They can also be represented by a pulse transfer function, which is the Z-transform equivalent of a continuous-time transfer function.
