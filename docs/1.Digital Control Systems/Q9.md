**Given Transfer Function:**

The given transfer function is:

$$
G(z) = \frac{Y(z)}{U(z)} = \frac{0.5z^2 + z}{z^3 + 0.6z^2 + 0.5z + 0.3}
$$

**Step 1: Rewrite the Transfer Function in Terms of $$z^{-1}$$**

To convert the transfer function into a form suitable for state-space representation, we divide the numerator and denominator by the highest power of $$z$$ (which is $$z^3$$ in this case):

$$
G(z) = \frac{Y(z)}{U(z)} = \frac{0.5z^{-1} + z^{-2}}{1 + 0.6z^{-1} + 0.5z^{-2} + 0.3z^{-3}}
$$

This step ensures that the transfer function is expressed in terms of negative powers of $$z$$, which is necessary for deriving the discrete state-space model (DSSM).

---

**Step 2: Identify the Coefficients**

From the rewritten transfer function, we identify the coefficients of the numerator and denominator:

- **Numerator Coefficients:**
  - $$b_0 = 0$$ (coefficient of $$z^0$$)
  - $$b_1 = 0.5$$ (coefficient of $$z^{-1}$$)
  - $$b_2 = 1$$ (coefficient of $$z^{-2}$$)

- **Denominator Coefficients:**
  - $$a_1 = 0.6$$ (coefficient of $$z^{-1}$$)
  - $$a_2 = 0.5$$ (coefficient of $$z^{-2}$$)
  - $$a_3 = 0.3$$ (coefficient of $$z^{-3}$$)

These coefficients will be used to construct the state-space matrices.

---

**Step 3: Define the State Variables**

For a third-order system (degree of denominator = 3), we define three state variables:

$$
x_1(k) = y(k-3)
$$

$$
x_2(k) = y(k-2)
$$

$$
x_3(k) = y(k-1)
$$

These state variables represent delayed versions of the output $$y(k)$$.

---

**Step 4: Derive the State Equations**

The state equations are derived from the transfer function by expressing the output and state variables in terms of their delays.

- **Output Equation:**

  From the numerator of the transfer function:

  $$
  Y(z) = 0.5z^{-1}H(z) + z^{-2}H(z)
  $$

  In the time domain, this becomes:

  $$
  y(k) = 0.5x_3(k) + x_2(k)
  $$

- **State Update Equations:**

  From the denominator of the transfer function:

  $$
  H(z) = U(z) - 0.6z^{-1}H(z) - 0.5z^{-2}H(z) - 0.3z^{-3}H(z)
  $$

  In the time domain, this becomes:

  $$
  x_3(k+1) = u(k) - 0.6x_3(k) - 0.5x_2(k) - 0.3x_1(k)
  $$

  The remaining state update equations are:

  $$
  x_1(k+1) = x_2(k)
  $$

  $$
  x_2(k+1) = x_3(k)
  $$

---

**Step 5: Construct the State-Space Matrices**

The state-space representation is given by:

$$
x(k+1) = A x(k) + B u(k)
$$

$$
y(k) = C x(k) + D u(k)
$$

- **State Matrix $$A$$:**

  $$
  A = \begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 \\
  -0.3 & -0.5 & -0.6
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

  This matrix captures the relationship between the current and next states.

- **Input Matrix $$B$$:**

  $$
  B = \begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  0 \\
  1
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

  This matrix represents the effect of the input $$u(k)$$ on the state variables.

- **Output Matrix $$C$$:**

  $$
  C = \begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 1 & 0.5
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

  This matrix defines how the state variables contribute to the output $$y(k)$$.

- **Feedthrough Matrix $$D$$:**

  $$
  D = 0
  $$

  There is no direct feedthrough from the input to the output.

---

**Step 6: Simulation Diagram**

The simulation diagram can be constructed using the state-space equations. It consists of:

1. **Delay Blocks ($$z^{-1}$$):** Represent the state variables $$x_1(k)$$, $$x_2(k)$$, and $$x_3(k)$$.
2. **Summation Nodes:** Combine the inputs and state variables as per the state equations.
3. **Gain Blocks:** Multiply the state variables and input by their respective coefficients (e.g., $$-0.3$$, $$-0.5$$, $$-0.6$$, $$0.5$$, and $$1$$).

---

**Final Discrete State-Space Model (DSSM):**

The final DSSM is given by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x(k+1) &= \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
-0.3 & -0.5 & -0.6
\end{bmatrix} x(k) + \begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
1
\end{bmatrix} u(k) \\
y(k) &= \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0.5
\end{bmatrix} x(k)
\end{aligned}
$$

This model accurately represents the given transfer function in state-space form.

**Only read if you have confusion about the input matrix $$B$$**


To determine the input matrix $$B$$ in the state-space representation, we start by examining the state update equations derived from the given transfer function:

$$
G(z) = \frac{Y(z)}{U(z)} = \frac{0.5z^2 + z}{z^3 + 0.6z^2 + 0.5z + 0.3}
$$

The state update equations are:

$$
x_1(k+1) = x_2(k)
$$

$$
x_2(k+1) = x_3(k)
$$

$$
x_3(k+1) = -0.3x_1(k) - 0.5x_2(k) - 0.6x_3(k) + u(k)
$$

These equations describe how the state variables evolve over time. The input $$u(k)$$ directly influences the state variables through the input matrix $$B$$.

---

### **Step 1: General State-Space Form**

The general state-space form is:

$$
x(k+1) = A x(k) + B u(k)
$$

Here:
- $$A$$ is the state matrix, which defines how the current states influence the next states.
- $$B$$ is the input matrix, which defines how the input $$u(k)$$ influences the next states.

---

### **Step 2: Deriving the Input Matrix $$B$$**

The input matrix $$B$$ is determined by analyzing how the input $$u(k)$$ affects each state variable. From the state update equations:

1. **For $$x_1(k+1)$$:**
   $$
   x_1(k+1) = x_2(k)
   $$
   - The input $$u(k)$$ does not appear in this equation, so $$u(k)$$ has **no direct effect** on $$x_1(k+1)$$.
   - This means the first row of $$B$$ is $$0$$.

2. **For $$x_2(k+1)$$:**
   $$
   x_2(k+1) = x_3(k)
   $$
   - The input $$u(k)$$ does not appear in this equation, so $$u(k)$$ has **no direct effect** on $$x_2(k+1)$$.
   - This means the second row of $$B$$ is $$0$$.

3. **For $$x_3(k+1)$$:**
   $$
   x_3(k+1) = -0.3x_1(k) - 0.5x_2(k) - 0.6x_3(k) + u(k)
   $$
   - The input $$u(k)$$ appears directly in this equation with a coefficient of $$1$$.
   - This means the third row of $$B$$ is $$1$$.

---

### **Step 3: Constructing the Input Matrix $$B$$**

Based on the above analysis, the input matrix $$B$$ is:

$$
B = \begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Intuitive Explanation**

- The input $$u(k)$$ only directly affects the third state variable $$x_3(k+1)$$, as seen in the state update equation for $$x_3(k+1)$$.
- The first two state variables, $$x_1(k+1)$$ and $$x_2(k+1)$$, are updated based on the previous states and are **not directly influenced** by the input $$u(k)$$. Hence, their corresponding entries in $$B$$ are $$0$$.

---

### **Final Input Matrix $$B$$**

The input matrix $$B$$ for this system is:

$$
B = \begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This means:
- The input $$u(k)$$ has no direct effect on $$x_1(k+1)$$ and $$x_2(k+1)$$.
- The input $$u(k)$$ directly affects $$x_3(k+1)$$ with a coefficient of $$1$$.

---

### **Summary**

The input matrix $$B$$ is derived by analyzing how the input $$u(k)$$ influences each state variable. In this case, since $$u(k)$$ only appears in the equation for $$x_3(k+1)$$, the input matrix $$B$$ has zeros in the first two rows and a $$1$$ in the third row. This ensures that the input directly affects only the third state variable.
