The goal is to represent a sampled signal in the s-domain, which is useful for analyzing systems that involve sampling, such as digital control systems.


## Laplace Transform and the s-Domain:
The Laplace transform converts a time-domain function, $f(t)$, into an s-domain function, $F(s)$. This transform is defined as:

$$
\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} = F(s) = \int_0^\infty f(t)e^{-st} dt
$$

## Sampled Signal Representation:
When a continuous signal, $f(t)$, is sampled, the output is a discrete-time signal, $f^*(t)$. Mathematically, this sampled signal can be represented as the product of the original signal and a unit pulse train, $p(t)$:

$$
f^*(t) = f(t) \cdot p(t)
$$

---

## Unit Pulse Train:
The unit pulse train, $p(t)$, is a series of pulses with unit amplitude, occurring at regular intervals (the sampling period, $T$). It acts as a switch, effectively "picking out" values of the continuous signal at the sampling instants.

---

## s-Domain Representation of Sampled Signal:
Taking the Laplace transform of the sampled signal representation yields:

$$
F^*(s) = \mathcal{L}\{f^*(t)\} = F(s) \otimes P(s)
$$

Where $\otimes$ denotes complex convolution, and $P(s)$ is the Laplace transform of the unit pulse train, $p(t)$.

---

## Flat-top Approximation:
If the sampling duration ($p$) is significantly shorter than the sampling period ($T$) and the smallest time constant of the original signal, the sampler output can be approximated by a sequence of rectangular pulses. Under this approximation, the sampled signal can be simplified as:

$$
f^*(t) \approx f(kT) \cdot p(t)
$$

Where $kT$ represents the sampling instants. This simplification significantly reduces the complexity of analysis.

---

## The Ideal Sampler:
In an ideal sampler, the sampling duration $p$ approaches zero, implying instantaneous sampling. This means the sampler switches between closed and open states instantaneously. The output of an ideal sampler is usually represented using the unit impulse function, $\delta(t)$:

$$
f^*(t) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} f(kT) \delta(t-kT)
$$

Taking the Laplace transform results in:

$$
F^*(s) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} f(kT)e^{-kTs}
$$
